#Congruence-Coefficients-for-Factor-Analysis

Excel spreadsheet to calculate congruence coefficients comparing the results of factor analyses

Congruence coefficients measure the similarity of a pair of matrices or vectors. They are sometimes used to compare the loadings obtained from a factor analysis. This spreadsheet takes two sets of factor loadings and computes the congruence coefficient for each pair of factors. The spreadsheet will compare up to 8 factors based on up to 200 items.
